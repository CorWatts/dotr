# Dotr

Is your significant other's love language "receiving gifts?"

Mine is. 

Dotr is a fun little app, built in NodeJS and Material AngularJS, to help keep track of gifts you can give.

## Installation
`npm install` in both client and server directories  
`cd server`  
`cp start.sh.example start.sh`  
Replace variables in start.sh with your google custom search tokens  
`bash start.sh`
